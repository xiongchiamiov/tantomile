There are lots and lots and lots of choices when it comes to alcohol, and as a
newbie to the field I find it difficult to choose what to explore.  So, I
thought I'd make something like Pandora, but for alcohol.

Because I don't have infinite amounts of time, rather than manually assigning
characteristics like Pandora I figured I'd scrape a few review sites and pull
out weighted keywords.

Catchy name forthcoming.
